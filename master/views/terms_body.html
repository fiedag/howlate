            How-Late grants you a limited, revocable, non-exclusive, non-sublicensable license to use the How-Late API using the downloadable Agent provided by How-Late.  If you wish to call the How-Late API using your own program, then you may do so subject to the following restrictions. You may not:

    <div class="panel panel-default">
        <div class="panel-heading"><h1 class="panel-title">6. Use of Forums</h1></div>
        <div class="panel-body">
            The Service includes discussion forums, bulletin boards, reviews or other forums in which you or third parties may post reviews or other content, messages, materials or other items on the Service ("Interactive Areas"). If How-Late provides such Forums, you are solely responsible for your use of such Forums and use them at your own risk. User Content submitted to any public area of the Service will be considered non-confidential. You agree not to post, upload to, transmit, distribute, store, create or otherwise publish through the Service any of the following:
            <ul>
                <li>Any message, data, information, text, music, sound, photos, graphics, code or other material that is unlawful, libellous, defamatory, obscene, pornographic, indecent, lewd, suggestive, harassing, threatening, invasive of privacy or publicity rights, abusive, inflammatory, fraudulent or otherwise objectionable;</li>
                <li>Content that would constitute, encourage or provide instructions for a criminal offense, violate the rights of any party, or that would otherwise create liability or violate any local, state, national or international law;</li>
                <li>Content that may infringe any patent, trademark, trade secret, copyright or other intellectual or proprietary right of any party;</li>
                <li>Content that impersonates any person or entity or otherwise misrepresents your affiliation with a person or entity;</li>
                <li>Unsolicited promotions, political campaigning, advertising or solicitations;</li>
                <li>Private information of any third party, including, without limitation, addresses, phone numbers, email addresses and credit card numbers, unless that third party has expressly consented to such use;</li>
                <li>Viruses, corrupted data or other harmful, disruptive or destructive files;</li>
                <li>Content that is unrelated to the topic of the Interactive Area(s) in which such Content is posted; or</li>
                <li>Content that, in the sole judgment of How-Late, is objectionable or which restricts or inhibits any other person from using or enjoying the Interactive Areas or the Service, or which may expose How-Late or its affiliates or its users to any harm or liability of any type.</li>
            </ul>
            Finally, How-Late has a "zero-tolerance" policy towards SPAM: you may not use the Service to send commercial or other messages to any third-party if those messages are not solicited, authorized or welcomed by the third-party, and in your use of the Service you must comply with all applicable laws, including laws that apply in any jurisdiction to SPAM and marketing practices, and with any applicable marketing association guidelines on ethical marketing practices.<br>
            Any use of the Interactive Areas or other portions of the Service in violation of the foregoing violates these Terms and may result in, among other things, termination or suspension of your rights to use the Service.

        <div class="panel-heading"><h1 class="panel-title">7. Providing a Reliable and Secure Service</h1></div>
        <div class="panel-body">

            <p>If you have spent any time reviewing the Service, you will hopefully have noticed that we take reliability and security seriously. We put a great deal of effort into ensuring that our service operates 100% of the time, and that it is a secure environment for your data. We use what we believe to be "best-of-class" hosting Services and security technologies and Services that we believe provide you with a secure and safe environment. More information about these Services and technologies is available on the Site.
            <p>For example, to safeguard credit card information, How-Late uses industry-accredited gateway provider CHARGEOVER.COM who encrypts all stored credit card numbers, uses restrictive firewalls to protect stored data and uses 256 bit SSL certificates to encrypt data transferred between you and the Service.
            <p>However, no system is perfectly secure or reliable, the Internet is an inherently insecure medium, and the reliability of hosting Service, Internet intermediaries, your Internet service provider, and other service providers cannot be assured. When you use How-Late, you accept these risks, and the responsibility for choosing to use a technology that does not provide perfect security or reliability. In particular, Subscribers who enable auto-billing and choose to store the credit card information of their Customers accept these risks to the security of that credit card information. How-late will not be held responsible for the reliability, security and safety of the billing gateway third party.

You use the Service at your own risk.
            <p>Without limitation of the foregoing, neither How-Late nor any other Released Party shall be liable for any direct, special, indirect or consequential damages, or any other damages of any kind, including but not limited to loss of use, loss of profits or loss of data, whether in an action in contract, tort (including but not limited to negligence) or otherwise, arising out of or in any way connected with the use of or inability to use the Site, the Agent or the Forum, including without limitation any damages caused by or resulting from your reliance on the Site, the Agent or the Forum or other information obtained from How-Late or any other Released Party or accessible via the Site, the Agent or the Forum, or that result from mistakes, errors, omissions, interruptions, deletion of files or email, defects, viruses, delays in operation or transmission or any failure of performance, whether or not resulting from Acts of God, communications failure, theft, destruction or unauthorized access to How-Late or any other Released Party's records, programs or services.
            <p>In no event shall the aggregate liability of How-Late, whether in contract, warranty, tort (including negligence, whether active, passive or imputed), product liability, strict liability or other theory, arising out of or relating to the use of the Site, the Agent or the Forum exceed any compensation paid by you for access to or use of the Site, the Agent or the Forum, as the case may be, during the three months prior to the date of any claim.
            <p>You shall defend, indemnify and hold harmless How-Late and the other Released Parties from any loss, damages, liabilities, costs, expenses, claims and proceedings arising out of your use of the Site, the Content, the Add-ons and the Service, and if you are a Subscriber, from your Practitioners’ use of the Service and from the use of the Site, the Content, the Add-ons and the Service by any person to whom you give access to your account (including as staff), including any claims made by any person that any of your, and if you are a Subscriber, your Practitioners’, User Content infringes the rights, including the intellectual property rights, of any third party.

        <div class="panel-heading"><h1 class="panel-title">10. Applicable Law and Venue</h1></div>
        <div class="panel-body">

            <p>The Service are controlled by How-Late and operated by it from its offices in Adelaide, South Australia. You and How-Late both benefit from establishing a predictable legal environment in regard to the Service. Therefore, you and How-Late explicitly agree that all disputes, claims or other matters arising from or relating to your use of the Service will be governed by the laws of South Australia and the federal laws of Australia applicable therein. The United Nations Convention on Contracts for the International Sale of Goods does not apply to these Terms.
            <p>Except where prohibited by applicable law, any claim, dispute or controversy (whether in contract or tort, pursuant to statute or regulation, or otherwise, and whether pre-existing, present or future) involving How-Late and arising out of or relating to (a) these Terms; (b) the Site, the Agent or the Forum; (c) oral or written statements, advertisements or promotions relating to these Terms or to the Site, the Agent or the Forum; or (d) the relationships that result from these Terms or the Site, the Agent or the Forum (collectively, a "Claim"), will be referred to and determined by a sole arbitrator (to the exclusion of the courts). Except where prohibited by applicable law, you waive any right you may have to commence or participate in any class action against How-Late related to any Claim and, where applicable, you also agree to opt out of any class proceedings against How-Late. If you have a Claim, you should give written notice to arbitrate at the address specified below. If we have a Claim, we will give you notice to arbitrate at your address provided in your Registration Data. Arbitration will be conducted by one arbitrator pursuant to the commercial arbitration laws and rules in effect on the date of the notice in the state of South Australia.
            <p>To the extent arbitration as described in the immediately preceding paragraph is prohibited by applicable law, you agree that all Claims will be heard and resolved in a court of competent subject matter jurisdiction located in Adelaide, South Australia. You consent to the personal jurisdiction of such courts over you, stipulate to the fairness and convenience of proceeding in such courts, and covenant not to assert any objection to proceeding in such courts.
            <p>If you choose to access the Service from locations other than South Australia, you will be responsible for compliance with all local laws of such other jurisdiction and you agree to indemnify How-Late and the other Released Parties for your failure to comply with any such laws.

        <div class="panel-body">

            <p>Notwithstanding any provision of these Terms, How-Late reserves the right, without notice and in its sole discretion, without any notice or liability to you, to (a) terminate your license to use the Service, or any portion thereof (including any use of any Add-on) and the rights of any third party to which you have granted access to your User Content through the How-Late API; (b) block or prevent your future access to and use of all or any portion of the Service or Content (including any use of any Add-on) and the rights of any third party to which you have granted access to your User Content through the How-Late API; (c) change, suspend or discontinue any aspect of the Service or Content; and (d) impose limits on the Service or Content.

            <p>If your account is inactive for at least two months, we may deactivate your account. Deactivated accounts are not deleted—they are placed in storage and can be restored. We will notify you by email if we decide to deactivate your account. If you know in advance that your account will be inactive at some time and don’t want us to deactivate it, let us know in advance at support[at]How-Late.com . If after your account has been deactivated it stays inactive and we don’t hear from you, we may terminate it at any time and without notice.
            <p>You and How-Late may terminate your use of the Service including your agreement to these Terms at any time. If you terminate your use of the Service you must pay the fees applicable for the balance of the then current billing period (if your billing period is monthly, we will prorate your account to the nearest month-end after termination). When your How-Late account is terminated, your Site will, shortly thereafter, not appear on the Service, except for User Content submitted to public areas of the Site such as the blog, forum, or product reviews, which may remain on the Site after termination. We may also retain an archival copy of your User Content after termination, and you hereby grant us a non-exclusive, perpetual, irrevocable license to maintain such archival copy for our internal business purposes.
