                                            <p>
How-Late is committed to protecting the privacy of our customers and website users. We want to provide a safe, secure user experience. We will use our best efforts to ensure that the information that we have compiled and that you submit to us remains private. We do not disclose information about your individual visits to our website or your e-mail address to any outside parties, except with your permission. 
</p>
<p>
From time to time, we may use customer information for new, unanticipated uses not previously described in our Privacy Policy. If our information practices change at some time in the future, we will post those changes on the Site, and provide you with the ability to opt-out of those new uses. If you are concerned about how your information is used or disclosed, please check our online Privacy Policy from time-to-time.
</p>
<p>There are a number of areas on the How-Late website where we ask for and collect information about you, including personally identifiable information. Where we do, it is in order to serve you better, or is necessary to accomplish the service you are requesting. Examples include name, address, email, telephone number, educational and professional experience information, security identifiers, shipping information, and product purchase information.
</p>
<p>
Information collected from third party software systems by How-Late agent programs is limited to that permissible by the corresponding legislation covering appropriate use.  
Information on practitioners is limited to the full name of the doctor.  No information allowing patients to be identified is captured or stored by How-Late.  Where patient preferences about SMS notifications are recorded and available within a practice management database, these settings will be respected.
</p>
<p>
Cookies are implemented in various parts of the How-Late Site. In most instances, the use of Cookies is discretionary by you, and declining Cookies will usually result only in loss of certain conveniences such as session continuity and re-authentication during current or future sessions. It is the policy of How-Late that Cookies do not carry any of your personal information (name, email address, credit card, etc.) nor identification/password-type data that allows access to such personal information on this web site.
</p>
<p>
This Site contains links to other sites. How-Late is not responsible for the terms or privacy practices of such other sites and you should read their terms and privacy policy carefully before using them.
How-Late cooperates with law enforcement inquiries, as well as other third parties, to enforce laws. 
</p>
<p>
We can (and you authorize us to) disclose any information about you to law enforcement or other government officials as we, in our sole discretion, believe necessary or appropriate, in connection with an investigation of fraud, intellectual property infringements, or other activity that is illegal or may expose us, service or content providers we work with, or you to possible legal liability.
Please contact us with any questions you have about our privacy policy.

By using this website, you acknowledge that you've read and understood this privacy policy. Please note that this policy does not extend your rights or How-Late's obligations beyond those defined in the legislation.  Should there be any inconsistency between this policy, the Privacy Act and other Acts mentioned above, this policy shall be interpreted to give effect to and comply with the legislation.
This policy includes examples but is not intended to be restricted in its application to such examples. Where the word 'including' is used, it shall mean 'including without limitation'.
